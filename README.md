# 🌌 Constellation Pathway Mediator

The **Constellation Pathway Mediator** is a Clarity-based smart contract protocol designed to facilitate secure, structured, and recoverable resource transfers between blockchain entities. It offers robust verification mechanisms, staged transfer workflows, expiration handling, and multi-tier dispute resolution to support mission-critical digital asset interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🛠️ **Staged Transfers**: Initiate multi-phase transfers with stage-specific validation.
- 🔐 **Advanced Security**: Enable high-value transaction protection via cryptographic proofs.
- ⚖️ **Dispute Resolution**: Resolve conflicts with adjudication and proportional asset allocation.
- 📦 **Metadata Support**: Attach verifiable metadata to any transaction.
- 👥 **Ownership Reassignment**: Reassign transaction ownership securely.
- 🧩 **Anonymous Verifications**: Prove facts with zero-knowledge proof support for high-value operations.
- ⏳ **Resource Reclaiming**: Reclaim unclaimed/expired assets automatically.
- 🔁 **Backup Plans & Rate Limiting**: Add fail-safe agents and transaction throttling.
